# In Silence for Minecraft

In Silence is a multiplayer co-op survival game in which 1 player becomes a monster that seeks out the other players. This map is an in-depth recreation of the game, including flashlights, noisemakers, and of course, the monster!

Notes:
This download includes a map with a custom datapack, a couple resource packs, and a custom mod.

## Recommendations:
* Please enable all provided resource packs for the best experience.
* Consider turning down your FOV effects to 20% or lower.
* Do not use any shaders or lighting mods, they will likely ruin the effects.
* If you are using the voice chat mod, turn down voice distance to 15 blocks or lower in the config.
* If you don't have access to a server, use a mod like Essentials to host your world.
